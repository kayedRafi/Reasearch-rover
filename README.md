   - Creates linked list
   - Inserts research topics from files
   - Manages data organization

2. **USER_SEARCH Function**
   - Processes user search input
   - Performs keyword matching
   - Returns relevant results

3. **MERGE AND SORT Operation**
   - Combines search results
   - Sorts based on relevance
   - Optimizes output presentation

## Installation

### Prerequisites
